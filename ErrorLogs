1. Reactor would not work with OP.Accept
Cause: SelectionKey is a non blocking IO, but I had set the mode to BLOCKING = TRUE.
Solution: Make it a non blocking

2. Splitting bytes in high and low bytes for block number in data packet

3. It might be better to work chronologically on how the system works because adding features you think you need will not always be true

4. look into handler. sending multiple packets back to client issue
        // 0 vs 1? causing issue.
           sk = socket.register(sel, SelectionKey.OP_READ);

5. if packet size is not max,
              while (dataBuffer.position() < MAX_PACKET_SIZE) {
                    clientChannel.read(dataBuffer);
                }

Architect:
1. Start Reactor
2. Reactor waits for client message
3. Send message through Client
4. Once message is received, dispatch to create the handler
5.
