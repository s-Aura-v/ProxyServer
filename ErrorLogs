1. Reactor would not work with OP.Accept
Cause: SelectionKey is a non blocking IO, but I had set the mode to BLOCKING = TRUE.
Solution: Make it a non blocking

2. Splitting bytes in high and low bytes for block number in data packet

Architect:
1. Start Reactor
2. Reactor waits for client message
3. Send message through Client
4. Once message is received, dispatch to create the handler
5.
